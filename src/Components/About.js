          <h3>About MoodReads</h3>
          <p>
            My love for reading inspired me to create this app. There are many tools designed to help find a book to read - for example, the GoodReads app which I rely on heavily. While these resources are good for finding books based on genre or titles similar to those you have already read, they lack a personal, and less-specific element. Sometimes you are looking for a book that matches a certain 'vibe'. MoodReads recreates the experience of asking for book recommendations from a well-read friend. Instead of searching for a book by genre, our app enables you to find a new read by emotion.
